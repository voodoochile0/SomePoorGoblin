Welcome to Some Poor Goblin

I wanted to make a game so here we are.
You're a lone goblin, exiled by the ruthless goblin king after you failed to properly evade your taxes.

IDEAS:
A Dark Room type game
Lots of wandering traders with a wide variety of goods based on their faction
Faction relations
Number of goblins attracted to your settlement is based on the value of your treasury
Can get attacked if relations are Poor
Can raise defenses with enough weapons and armor, or even send troops to attack

Progression:
Click a lot to get logs, click a lot to cut into planks
Click a lot to get rocks
Build a poor sawmill to make planks with less clicks
Click a lot to get ores
Build a furnace to smelt into bars
Build a mint to craft coins from bars
Build houses for goblins
Build a treasury to attract goblins
Assign workers to various tasks and pay a wage based on job difficulty
Build a forge and begin an army

Buildings:
